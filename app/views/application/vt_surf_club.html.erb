        <h1>THE VIRGINIA TECH SURF CLUB</h1>
            <h2>THE GOAL</h2>
                <p>Create an upbeat, informative, and usable site for the Virginia Tech Surf club</p>
                <hr class="hrSub" />
        <h2>STRATEGY</h2>
            <p>We worked with the Surf Club and a graphics artist they had selected to create a website to promote club activities.</p>
           <hr class="hrSub" />
        <h2>IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
            <h3>DESIGN</h3>
            <p>The design we created was intended to appeal to the target audience which was 18-35 year old males.  The app squares, which were already created by the app developers, provided a colorful and fun look which we used to show that the site includes all kinds of apps.  We wanted to incorporate the app squares as much as possible to help complete the look of the site.</p>
            <h3>DEVELOPMENT</h3>
            <p>The design was presented to us by a graphics artist who showed us the general style and gave us the image graphics.  We took the design and worked on the usability aspects to create a cleaner and intuitive interface.</p>
            <hr class="hrSub" />
            <h2>RESULTS</h2>
                <p>The Virginia Tech Surf club now has a large member base and large turnout on events thanks to the website.</p>
